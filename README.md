## This repository

This code is deployed onto the chicken coop raspberry pi computer.

Edit code, commit/push, then deploy with `./deploy`. The deploy script also documents summaries, source, and destination for all code deployed to the pi.

Use `tree Chicken bin` on the Pi to see all deployed code.

## Hardware

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2. Bought off Amazon.com.

* 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU
* 1 GB RAM
* 802.11n Wireless LAN, 10/100Mbps Lan Speed
* Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth Low Energy
* 4 USB ports, 40 GPIO pins, Full HDMI port, Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video
* Camera interface (CSI), Display interface (DSI), Micro SD card slot (now push-pull rather than push-push), VideoCore IV 3D graphics core
* 32 GB SD card

## Operating system

The operating system ([raspbian jesse with PIXEL desktop, v2017-04-10](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)) was written to a 32GB SD card using [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) following [this install guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md). Something doesn't seem to work with 64GB SD cards... I bricked one before I got it to work on a 32GB SD card.

### `gpio`

The pre-installed `gpio` program can read and manipulate general purpose IO pins.

NOTE: `sudo` is not required to run `gpio` (`Adeept_Starter_Kit_for_RPi_User_Manual.pdf` is out of date in this regard).

      * This Raspberry Pi supports user-level GPIO access.

Watch GPIO pin status, highlighting cumulative differences (this is an undocumented feature of `watch`). 1-second resolution.

    watch -dc -n 1 gpio readall

NOTE: this didn't work for checking mag (hall effect) sensors, I had to use Python code for that. See ./src/scripts/hall-effect-sensor.py . Well, it sorta worked, just not reliably. During testing I noticed the mag sensor values reading incorrect values frequently.

## Video

During daylight hours when the door is open, Video is captured upon motion detection and uploaded to YouTube. There are several pieces making up this system:

* [motion](https://motion-project.github.io/) is run by systemd
    * stopped at night
* motion triggers the upload to YouTube
    * see the `on_movie_end` handler in `src/motion.conf`
    * `youtube-upload` wraps `youtube-upload.py` to handle errors
    * the YouTube ID is written to a file during upload to detect failed uploads
* youtube-flush is scheduled in pi's crontab
    * posts Slack notification on successful and failed video uploads
    * YouTube ID is flushed (deleted)

## Bugs

### network interruption requires power cycle

My raspberry pi is connected via wifi. It still works offline, but it's best if it is on the network so it can send log messages, photos, and video clips. It usually works fine and stays online for weeks or months. If I reboot the wifi access point it is connected to, the pi is unable to reconnect and a power cycle is required.

I tried the `watchdog` package as well as this script from root's crontab:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    ping -c4 192.168.13.1 > /dev/null
    
    # neither ifup/ifdown nor `shutdown -r now` works
    if [[ $? != 0 ]]
    then
        logger "No network connection, rebooting"
        shutdown -r now
        # logger "No network connection, restarting wlan0"
        # ifdown wlan0
        # sleep 8
        # ifup wlan0
    fi

I also disabled wifi power save by adding `wireless-power off` to the interface in `/etc/network/interfaces`. This does disable wifi power save, but still doesn't help wifi automatically reconnect.

Only workaround is a power cycle.

### imgurpython

[imgurpython](https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython) is no longer maintained. One extant issue is with image uploading. As-is you'll get this error:

    Endpoint/3/upload does not exist

You can do this manually with something like `sudo editor /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/imgurpython/client.py`.
